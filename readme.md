Created a comprehensive database for an online bookstore, including the design of the ER-Diagram and Schema. Implemented the database using ORACLE and wrote PL/SQL code to extract information based on various options. For example, developed queries to retrieve book information by co-authors, such as identifying books co-authored by two or three individuals and calculating the total count for each category (e.g., 10 books with two co-authors, 20 books with three co-authors).
